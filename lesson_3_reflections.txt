When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to work on a project located on GitHub. You would use a remote
    reposity so you can work on the project remotely and push commits once you
    are ready to commit changes to GitHub.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git

    There may be others contributing to projects simultaneous or there may not
    be any updates on GitHub and in such case pulling would be inefficient.
