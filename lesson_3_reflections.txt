When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to work on a project located on GitHub. You would use a remote
    reposity so you can work on the project remotely and push commits once you
    are ready to commit changes to GitHub.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There may be others contributing to projects simultaneous or there may not
    be any updates on GitHub and in such case pulling would be inefficient.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: When you'd like your someone else's work on GitHub whether to
           collaborate or use their code.
    Clones: When you want to use your own code from GitHub on your personal
            computer.
    Branches: When you want to work on an experimental feature to be later
              added to your main project or when you want to correct a bug.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
